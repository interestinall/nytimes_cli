# NytimesCli

This gem provides a command line interface for accessing the articles displayed on the front page of The New York Times (nytimes.com). 

All articles Â© The New York Times

This gem is intended to be a supplement to a subscription, not a replacement. I am a subscriber and encourage you to subscribe as well.  http://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp3004.html

Without institutions like The New York Times, the public will get even more of its news in the form of clickbait garbage. So pay up if you can.

## Installation


Install it yourself:

    $ gem install nytimes_cli

## Usage

Run the program:

    $ nytimes_cli

It's pretty self-explanatory. Type in 'man' to get a list of possible commands.

## Development

Fork it. Mess with it. Send a PR.

To run from the command line: 
    
    $ ruby bin/nytimes
